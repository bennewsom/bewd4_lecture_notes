Congratulations on joining us at General Assembly for the __Back-End Web Development__ course! **All your class files can be found here**.

## GITHUB CLASS REPOSITORY

Welcome to the GitHub class repository!

GitHub is a popular developer tool, and we want you to be familiar with it. GA is all about learning by doing, so in order to learn how to use GitHub we are going to use it every lesson as part of the course.

See "How do I use GitHub" below for instructions.

##How Do I Submit Homework?

Go to the [homework repository](https://github.com/shirren/BEWD_SYD_4_Homework) and follow the instructions there.

###What's in a lesson folder?

Each lesson folder contains

*	Code Alongs / Code Demos
*	Exercises
*	Readme (aka agenda)
*	Resources
*	Slides


##GRADING

In order to pass this course General Assembly students must:

*	Complete and submit 80% of all course homework assignments.

*	Complete and submit the course project (which may include a presentation), earning 	proficiency. See [Project Requirements](Final_Project/final_project_requirements.md).

## How do I use GitHub?

During the first lesson, you should make a copy of this repo for your own personal use (fork and then clone the repo).

From the terminal, clone by typing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/bewd4_lecture_notes.git
```

In addition, you should create a link to the instructor's copy on GitHub (add an upstream remote) so that you can download the latest version of your materials.

From the terminal, add an upstream remote by typing:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/shirren/bewd4_lecture_notes.git
```

Verify you added both remotes by typing:

```bash
git remote -v
```

We know it takes time to get familiar with GitHub so here are a few quick tips:

###How Do I Get Files From GitHub?

For each lesson the instructor will post slides, exercises and, solution files. To get these files, __pull__ (download) them from the instructor's repository (upstream).

From the terminal type:
(make sure you are in the correct directory)

```bash
git pull upstream master
```

###How Do I Post Files To My Forked Repository on GitHub?

Yes, you may have your files locally on your computer but consider pushing them to the cloud. Here are some benefits.

*	Easily share your homework with the instructional team for grading.
*	Share your files with your teammates.

To __push__ files to GitHub:

From the terminal type:
(make sure you are in the correct directory)

```bash
git add name_and_path_of_files_you_want_to_push
```

```bash
git commit -m "Enter commit message"
```

```bash
git push origin master
```

See this [link](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for more detailed information on fork, upstream, pull, and push:
